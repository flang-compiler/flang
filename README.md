Flang
=====

Flang is a Fortran compiler targeting LLVM.

Please join us for a Flang meetup at SC 17 in Denver. NVIDIA has reserved a room for the meetup on Wednesday, November 15 at 6:30 PM at the Curtis Hotel in the Hopscotch room (3rd floor). The Curtis is a block from the convention center. Light refreshments will be provided! (And maybe snacks, too.) We are looking forward to seeing you all face-to-face.

We have mailing lists for announcements and developers. Here's the link with the sign-up information:

http://lists.flang-compiler.org/mailman/listinfo

We have a flang-compiler channel on Slack.  Slack is invitation only but anyone can join.  Here's the link:

## Building Flang

We build Flang on Intel x86-64 and OpenPOWER hardware running either Ubuntu or Red Hat.

## Prerequisites

Building LLVM requires fairly modern compiler toolchain and CMake, check [Getting started with LLVM](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#host-c-toolchain-both-compiler-and-standard-library) and [Building LLVM with CMake][llvm-cmake] for the full list. 

## Dependencies

- modified LLVM
- openmp-llvm
- modified clang

The latest supported LLVM version is 6.0.  Flang also supports LLVM version 5.0.  To use 5.0, substitute 50 for 60 in the build instructions.

## Building

#### Custom install location

The command-line examples provided below will install everything into the default system location.

To specify a custom install location, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<INSTALL_PREFIX>` to each of the CMake commands given below.

When using a custom install location, you must make sure that the bin directory is on your PATH when building and running flang.

Flang is developed outside of the llvm source tree.

#### Step-by-step instructions

1. Get Flang LLVM, build and install it according to [instructions][llvm-cmake]
   ```
   cd where/you/want/to/build
   git clone https://github.com/flang-compiler/llvm.git
   cd llvm
   git checkout release_60
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake <your custom options> ..
   make 
   sudo make install
   ```

2. Get the flang driver, build and install it
   ```
   cd where/you/want/to/build
   git clone https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang-driver.git
   cd flang-driver
   git checkout release_60
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake <your custom options> ..
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
   
   If you use `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` in Step 1 and `<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin` is not in your path, you need to add `-DLLVM_CONFIG=<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin/llvm-config` when invoking CMake, otherwise you will encounter an error related to `LLVMConfig.cmake` not being found.

3. Build and install openmp-llvm
   ```
   cd where/you/want/to/build
   git clone https://github.com/llvm-mirror/openmp.git
   cd openmp/runtime
   git checkout release_60
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake <your custom options> ..
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

4. Build and install the flang components
   ```
   cd where/you/want/to/build
   git clone https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang.git
   cd flang
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake <your custom options> ..
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

   Custom options for building the flang components should include something like `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=flang` or `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=flang -DFLANG_LLVM_EXTENSIONS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<INSTALL_PREFIX>`.
   
   If you use `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` in Step 1 and `<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin` is not in your path, you need to add `-DLLVM_CONFIG=<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin/llvm-config` and set the explicit paths for the compilers (i.e. ` -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin/clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin/clang -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin/flang`) when invoking CMake, otherwise you will encounter errors.

#### (Alternative:) Build flang using Spack

[Spack](https://github.com/LLNL/spack) is a flexible package manager for HPC system and can be used to build flang and its dependencies.

1. Get Spack
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/llnl/spack.git
   ```
   
   On bash:
   ```
   source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
   ```
   or tcsh:
   ```
   source spack/share/spack/setup-env.csh
   ```
   

2. Build Flang and its depencencies:
   ```
   spack install flang
   ```
   watch out for the installation path, the flang wrapper script in there is ready to use.

3. (optional) setup Flang as a compiler inside spack if you want to build spack package with flang:
   ```
   spack compiler add path/to/flang/bin
   ```
   Now you might want to edit your `~/.spack/*/compilers.yaml` to combine `flang` with any c compiler of your choice.
   

## Using Flang

To test your installation, create a simple "hello world" program, like the following:

```
program hello
  print *, 'hello world'
end
```

Next, compile the program in the following manner. We will assume the program is called hello.f90

```
% flang hello.f90
```

If the build succeeds, then you can execute the program in the following manner:

```
% ./a.out
```

## Compiler Options

For a list of compiler options, enter

```
% flang -help
```

The Flang compiler supports accepts all clang 4.0 compiler options and supports many, as well as the following flang-specific compiler options:

```lang-none
-noFlangLibs          Do not link against Flang libraries
-mp                   Enable OpenMP and link with with OpenMP library libomp

-Mno-backslash        Treat backslash like any other character
-Mbyteswapio          Swap byte-order for unformatted input/output
-Mfixed               Assume fixed-format source
-Mextend              Allow source lines up to 132 characters
